# Calculator terminal app

This terminal calculator is a small project I did to learn and train Rust.  
It is one of the first project I wrote in Rust, so there is probably a lot of badly writen code.

If you want to try the calculator, make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system.  
- (If not visit the official instalation page [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)).

Then just clone the repo and run `cargo run --release`.
