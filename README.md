# Calculator Terminal App

This terminal calculator is a small project I did to learn and practice Rust.  
It is one of the first projects I wrote in Rust, so there is probably a lot of poorly written code.  

If you want to try the calculator, make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system.  

- (If not, visit the official installation page [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)).  

Then just clone the repo and run `cargo run --release`.
